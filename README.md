# Otto Group: XGB Classifier

XG Boost is the most accurate modelling technique for structured data. This machine learning algorithm is the implementation of gradient boosting with several additional features focused on performance and speed.

I picked the dataset of the Otto Group Company from Kaggle for the implementation of this machine learning algorithm. This is a multi-class classification problem. Predicted that which product comes in which class.
